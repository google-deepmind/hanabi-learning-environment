hanabi\_learning\_environment is a research platform for Hanabi experiments. The file rl\_env.py provides an RL environment using an API similar to OpenAI Gym. A lower level game interface is provided in pyhanabi.py for non-RL methods like Monte Carlo tree search.

### Getting started

sudo apt-get install python-pip  # if you don't already have pip
pip install cffi                 # if you don't already have cffi
cmake .
make
python rl_env_example.py         # Runs RL episodes
python game_example.py           # Plays a game using the lower level interface
```
